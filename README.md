# Gilded-Rose-Tech-Test
A first attempt at the Gilded Rose Tech Test in Ruby in 3 hours


# Documenting my process step by step

- 1. Read and understand the requirements & legacy code. I used post it notes to have the requirements to hand and to separate out a lot of information into bite sized chunks.

- 2. Set up RSpec testing Suite & SimpleCov

- 3. Fixed first existing broken step in gilded_rose_spec

- 4. Separate Item class into it's own file & spec. Update GildedRose class to receive this as an injected class to better decouple these two separate classes.
