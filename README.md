# Gilded-Rose-Tech-Test
A first attempt at the Gilded Rose Tech Test in Ruby in 2.5 hours!

## Getting started

`$ git clone git@github.com:charlottebrf/Gilded-Rose-Tech-Test.git`
`$ bundle install`

## Usage

Run the files locally:
`$ ruby file_name.rb`

Run the program in a REPL to interact with classes and their methods, e.g. pry:

`$ pry`
```
require 'file_name.rb'
new ClassName
```

## Running tests

`$ rspec`


## Test suite

`Rspec`
`Simplecov`

## Test coverage

`x%`


# My Approach


# # Documenting my process step by step
As there's been such a short time frame, I've decided to document my decision process step by step.

1. Read and understand the requirements & legacy code. I used post it notes to have the requirements to hand and to separate out a lot of information into bite sized chunks. I wrote a lot of post it notes to make very long instructions more visually appealing & organized in a way that made sense to me

2. Set up RSpec testing Suite & SimpleCov

3. Fixed first existing broken step in gilded_rose_spec

4. Separate Item class into it's own file & spec. Update GildedRose class to receive this as an injected class to better decouple these two separate classes.
